*Git Experiment

I Wander if this experiment is going to work

** Git Experiment to Upload

This is very interesting too
What are we going to do about gitHub?
Not sure if we are going to use this feature going forward.
It seems very powerful but there's quite a bit to it. It could potentially mess my code
Is there something to worry about? 
Need to embrace new technology and ideas. I shouldn't be worried about new tech.
If I am that worried I should ensure that I always have some kind of copy of 
work that I am doing
